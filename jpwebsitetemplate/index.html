            <h3>Motivated</h3>
            <p>
              From the time I woke up to the time I lay down I am driven and motivated to make
              something, anything important and productive happen. I enjoy the challenge that comes accomplishments and I enjoy assisting others in their challenges for the same. Motivation in the work environment is just as important as it is outside the work environment. It gives one purpose and the desire to do the best one can possibly do in anything they set out to do.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-12">
            <h3>Reliable</h3>
            <p>
              I learned in the Marines and in past work that it is always important to work a full day, regardless of how the day starts or how the day could potentially end. It is entirely too easy to call it quits when things veer off schedule or don't go completely as planned. But the satisfaction felt at the end of a crappy day knowing you stuck it out, clocked out at the end of your shift, and have the opportunity to write over tomorrow is far more important than the instant gratification that comes from immediately exiting a bad situation. Whether it is your fault or someone else's always work a full day. You can quit when the day is over if you like but always finish.

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-12">
            <h3>Happy</h3>
            <p>
              Anyone that knows me knows that I am a firm believer in the mindset that happiness and joy is a choice, not a feeling or a random happening. That doesn't mean I always get it right but I like to think I do my best. A happy mood can turn a bad day into a good one. It increases productivity in yourself and in others. It also increases the desire to be productive when you haven't been. It's hard to be happy and not want to get stuff done.

                      Unlike most, whether or not something discouraging happens in the day I don't it get in the way of work. I keep and maintain a positive attitude about the world and my impact in it, however large or small it may be. Honestly, I think most people are too petty about negativity even on the smallest scale and take life too seriously. A bad morning doesn't have to mean a bad day and a bad boss, or one that's having a tough time doesn't have to mean a bad job. Pride at work and happiness with job I hold aren't always the same thing, of course. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to have both and encourage others to do the same.

                    <p>I know a lot of information on a lot of different things, some applicable to work and some not. But whatever I don't know I can pick up very quickly. The Marine Corps (and marriage) has taught me to always do things as if time is of the most importance, because it often is. So to learn things in a quick and effective manner was a necessary skill to pick up. I can take the managing role or I can be one of the managed and put the same level of effort and precision into the tasks at hand. I became one of the go to guys in my department at Kooks Custom headers in Statesville NC after working there for a year without any prior knowledge of the exhaust and racing industry.</p>

                      Ultimately i'd like to become either the owner of a small company or reasoably high profile project manager. There's just something about holding on to the resources and information others are seeking and being able to help them in any way that I can to make the life they want happen. I don't know what industry exactly as I am one of those people with many different interests and not just one single passion. However, I have narrowed it down to creative imagination. I like the Adobe Creative products (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Audition, etc.) a lot and I have discovered I really enjoy web development and computer technology. So I guess a successful career as a PM or business owner somewhere in the creative/tech industries.

                      I want to be remembered as someone who put others first and accepted zero excuses when it comes to making dreams happen. In my opinion, people generally lack the patience needed to make the lives they want happen at all, much less in a reasonable amount of time. So when I'm gone from this world, I want my family to know me as someone that expected and created happiness and success for myself and anyone that I came in contact with. Someone that didn't sweat the small stuff and didn't avoid the big stuff. A little pressure never hurt anyone.
